# Color code
In this simple project one can see a color by knowing its code. If the color code is somehow invalid, the color turns black. 
I did this small excercise for having a better understanding of vanilla JS, inputs etc. 
Used components are as below : 
<ul>
<li> HTML basics </li>
<li> CSS basics </li>
<li> Vanilla JavaScript </li>
</ul>
